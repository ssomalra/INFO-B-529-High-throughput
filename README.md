# INFO-B-529-High-throughput
This repository contains the code for the INFO-B 529 Computational Analysis of High-throughput Biomedical Data Final Project, titled Transcriptome-wide influence of m6A modifications on translational outcomes. The project investigates how N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications impact translational efficiency and ribosome dynamics in HEK293T cells.

## Project Contents
- `RNAseq.sh`: Shell script for running the RNA-seq data processing pipeline.
- `RIBOseq.sh`: Shell script for running the Ribo-seq data processing pipeline.
- `nanopore.sh`: Shell script for running the nanopore direct RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) pipeline for m6A modification detection.
- `FinalProject.R`: R script for calculating translational efficiency and analyzing its relationship to m6A modifications.
